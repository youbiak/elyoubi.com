description: How I built my first website using Next.js
date: April 15, 2022

For years, I wanted to have my little personal space on the internet, a place where I can share my thoughts and experiences without being limited
by a platform format and in a way that I can tweak and adapt to my liking.

<br />

I'm curious about many topics and eager to learn new things. Not everything I write
here will be about programming. My goal is to share what I'm learning and experimenting
with while improving my writing.

<br />
That being said, you might wonder how this blog was built, let's deep into that.

<br />
#### Tech Stack

I was torn between Nuxt, Next, and Remix. I decided to go with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) because it's the most mature
one and I'm already familiar with it.

<br />

For styling, I decided to use [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/). It's a great library that I've wanted to test for a while.

<br />

For content, I'm using [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) to write my content in Markdown.
It allows me to embed React components and use them in my blog, you can check my [MDX Design System](/blog/design-system "design system") for examples.

<br />

The website is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), their service is awesome and I'm happy with their dashboard and deployment process.
