This is a random blog post to test the different components on my MDX Design System.

<br />
<br />

**Lorem Ipsum** has the industry's standard `dummy` text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

---

#### [Heading with link](#heading-with-link)

---

#### Code block

Supports syntax highlighting and line numbers

```javascript
console.log("code");
var foo = "yo";
```

```shell
npm run build
```

```text
console.log("code");
var foo = "yo";
```

Also supporting inline code `console.log('inline')`
